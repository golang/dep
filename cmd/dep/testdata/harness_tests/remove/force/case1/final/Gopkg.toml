## EXAMPLES & DOCS - safe to delete!
#
## Dependencies define constraints on how dependent projects should be
## incorporated into Gopkg.lock. They are respected by dep whether
## this project is the current project, or if it's a dependency.
# [[dependencies]]
## Required: the root import path of the project being constrained
# name = "github.com/user/project"
## Optional: an alternate location (URL or import path) for the project's source
# source = "https://github.com/myfork/package.git"
## Optional, but recommended: the version constraint to enforce for the project.
## Only one of "branch", "version" or "revision" can be specified.
# version = "1.0.0"
# branch = "master"
## Note: revision will depend on your repository type; git and hg have SHA1s,
## bzr a 3-part id, svn a revision number.
# revision = "abc123"
#
## [[overrides]] follow the exact same structure as [[dependencies]], but supercede
## all [[dependencies]] declarations from all projects. Only the current project's
## [[overrides]] are applied.
##
## Overrides are a sledgehammer, and should be used only as a last resort.
#
## "required" lists a set of packages (not projects) that must be included in
## Gopkg.lock. This list is merged with the set of packages imported by the current
## project. Use it when your project needs a package it doesn't explicitly import -
## including "main" packages.
# required = ["github.com/user/thing/cmd/thing"]
#
## "ignored" lists a set of packages (not projects) that are ignored when
## dep statically analyzes source code. Ignored packages can be in this project,
## or in a dependency.
# ignored = ["github.com/user/project/badpkg"]
