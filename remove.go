var removeCmd = &command{

	short: `[flags] [packages]
	Remove a package or a set of packages.
	`,
	long: `
Run it when:
To stop using dependencies
To clean out unused dependencies

What it does
Removes the given dependency from the Manifest, Lock, and vendor/.
If the current project includes that dependency in its import graph, rm will fail unless -force is specified.
If -unused is provided, specs matches all dependencies in the Manifest that are not reachable by the import graph.
The -force and -unused flags cannot be combined (an error occurs).
During removal, dependencies that were only present because of the dependencies being removed are also removed.

Note: this is a separate command to 'ensure' because we want the user to be explicit when making destructive changes.

Flags:
-n		Dry run, donâ€™t actually remove anything
-unused	Remove dependencies that are not used by this project
-force		Remove dependency even if it is used by the project
-keep-source	Do not remove source code
	`,
