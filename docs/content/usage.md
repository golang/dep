There is one main subcommand you will use: `dep ensure`. `ensure` first checks that `Gopkg.lock` is consistent with `Gopkg.toml` and the `import`s in your code. If any
changes are detected, `dep`'s solver works out a new `Gopkg.lock`. Then, `dep` checks if the contents of `vendor/` are what `Gopkg.lock` (the new one if applicable, else the existing one) says it should be, and rewrites `vendor/` as needed to bring it into line.

In essence, `dep ensure` [works in two phases to keep four buckets of state in sync](https://youtu.be/5LtMb090AZI?t=20m4s):

_Note: until we ship [vendor verification](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/121), we can't efficiently perform the `Gopkg.lock` <-> `vendor/` comparison, so `dep ensure` unconditionally regenerates all of `vendor/` to be safe._

`dep ensure` is safe to run early and often. See the help text for more detailed
usage instructions.

```sh
$ dep help ensure
```

## Installing dependencies

(if your `vendor/` directory isn't [checked in with your code](docs/FAQ.md#should-i-commit-my-vendor-directory))

<!-- may change with https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/489 -->

```sh
$ dep ensure
```

If a dependency already exists in your `vendor/` folder, dep will ensure it
matches the constraints from the manifest. If the dependency is missing from
`vendor/`, the latest version allowed by your manifest will be installed.

## Adding a dependency

```sh
$ dep ensure -add github.com/foo/bar
```

This adds a version constraint to your `Gopkg.toml`, and updates `Gopkg.lock` and `vendor/`. Now, import and use the package in your code! âœ¨

`dep ensure -add` has some subtle behavior variations depending on the project or package named, and the state of your tree. See `dep ensure -examples` for more information.

## Changing dependencies

If you want to:

* Change the allowed `version`/`branch`/`revision`
* Switch to using a fork

for one or more dependencies, do the following:

1. Manually edit your `Gopkg.toml`.
1. Run

    ```sh
    $ dep ensure
    ```

## Checking the status of dependencies

Run `dep status` to see the current status of all your dependencies.

```sh
$ dep status
PROJECT                             CONSTRAINT     VERSION        REVISION  LATEST
github.com/Masterminds/semver       branch 2.x     branch 2.x     139cc09   c2e7f6c
github.com/Masterminds/vcs          ^1.11.0        v1.11.1        3084677   3084677
github.com/armon/go-radix           *              branch master  4239b77   4239b77
```

On top of that, if you have added new imports to your project or modified `Gopkg.toml` without running `dep ensure` again, `dep status` will tell you there is a mismatch between `Gopkg.lock` and the current status of the project.

```sh
$ dep status
Lock inputs-digest mismatch due to the following packages missing from the lock:

PROJECT                         MISSING PACKAGES
github.com/Masterminds/goutils  [github.com/Masterminds/goutils]

This happens when a new import is added. Run `dep ensure` to install the missing packages.
```

As `dep status` suggests, run `dep ensure` to update your lockfile. Then run `dep status` again, and the lock mismatch should go away.

## Visualizing dependencies

Generate a visual representation of the dependency tree by piping the output of `dep status -dot` to [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).
#### Linux
```
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
$ dep status -dot | dot -T png | display
```
#### MacOS
```
$ brew install graphviz
$ dep status -dot | dot -T png | open -f -a /Applications/Preview.app
```
#### Windows
```
> choco install graphviz.portable
> dep status -dot | dot -T png -o status.png; start status.png
```

## Updating dependencies

Updating brings the version of a dependency in `Gopkg.lock` and `vendor/` to the latest version allowed by the constraints in `Gopkg.toml`.

You can update just a targeted subset of dependencies (recommended):

```sh
$ dep ensure -update github.com/some/project github.com/other/project
$ dep ensure -update github.com/another/project
```

Or you can update all your dependencies at once:

```sh
$ dep ensure -update
```

"Latest" means different things depending on the type of constraint in use. If you're depending on a `branch`, `dep` will update to the latest tip of that branch. If you're depending on a `version` using [a semver range](#semantic-versioning), it will update to the latest version in that range.

## Removing dependencies

1. Remove the `import`s and all usage from your code.
1. Remove `[[constraint]]` rules from `Gopkg.toml` (if any).
1. Run

    ```sh
    $ dep ensure
    ```

## Testing changes to a dependency

Making changes in your `vendor/` directory directly is not recommended, as dep
will overwrite any changes. Instead:

1. Delete the dependency from the `vendor/` directory.

    ```sh
    rm -rf vendor/<dependency>
    ```

1. Add that dependency to your `GOPATH`, if it isn't already.

    ```sh
    $ go get <dependency>
    ```

1. Modify the dependency in `$GOPATH/src/<dependency>`.
1. Test, build, etc.

Don't run `dep ensure` until you're done. `dep ensure` will reinstall the
dependency into `vendor/` based on your manifest, as if you were installing from
scratch.

This solution works for short-term use, but for something long-term, take a look
at [virtualgo](https://github.com/GetStream/vg).
