## Usage

Get the tool via

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/...
```

Typical usage on a new repo might be

```sh
$ dep init
$ dep ensure -update
```

To update a dependency to a new version, you might run

```sh
$ dep ensure github.com/pkg/errors@^0.8.0
```

See the help text for much more detailed usage instructions.

Note that **the manifest and lock file formats are not finalized**, and will likely change before the tool is released.
We make no compatibility guarantees for the time being.
Please don't commit any code or files created with the tool.
