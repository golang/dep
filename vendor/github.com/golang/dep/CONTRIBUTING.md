# Contributing to Dep

Dep is an open source project.

It is the work of hundreds of contributors. We appreciate your help!

Keep an eye on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap) for a summary of where the project is, and where we're headed.

## Filing issues

Please check the existing issues and [FAQ](FAQ.md) to see if your feedback has already been reported.

When [filing an issue](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/new), make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the [golang-nuts mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts) instead of the issue tracker.
The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

again.
