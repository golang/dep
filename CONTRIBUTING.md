# Contributing to Dep

Dep is an open source project.

It is the work of hundreds of contributors. We appreciate your help!

Keep an eye on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap) for a summary of where the project is, and where we're headed.

## Filing issues

When [filing an issue](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/new), make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the [golang-nuts mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts) instead of the issue tracker.
The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

## Contributing code

Please read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html)
before sending patches.

Unless otherwise noted, the Dep source files are distributed under
the BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
