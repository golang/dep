Dep is a prototype dependency management tool. It requires Go 1.7 or newer to compile.

`dep` is NOT an official tool. Yet. Check out the [Roadmap](https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap)!

## Current status

`dep` is safe for production use. That means two things:

* Any valid metadata file (`Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock`) will be readable and considered valid by any future version of `dep`.
* Generally speaking, it has comparable or fewer bugs than other tools out there.

That said, keep in mind the following:

* `dep` is still changing rapidly. If you need stability (e.g. for CI), it's best to rely on a released version, not tip.
* [Some changes](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/489) are pending to the CLI interface. Scripting on dep before they land is unwise.
* `dep`'s exported API interface will continue to change in unpredictable, backwards-incompatible ways until we tag a v1.0.0 release.

## Setup

Get the tool via

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

To start managing dependencies using dep, run the following from your project root directory:

```sh
$ dep init
```

This does the following:

1. Look for [existing dependency management files](docs/FAQ.md#what-external-tools-are-supported) to convert
1. Check if your dependencies use dep
1. Identify your dependencies
1. Back up your existing `vendor/` directory (if you have one) to
`_vendor-TIMESTAMP/`
1. Pick the highest compatible version for each dependency
1. Generate [`Gopkg.toml`](docs/Gopkg.toml.md) ("manifest") and `Gopkg.lock` files
1. Install the dependencies in `vendor/`

## Usage

There is one main subcommand you will use: `dep ensure`. `ensure` first makes
sure `Gopkg.lock` is consistent with your `import`s and `Gopkg.toml`. If any
changes are detected, it then populates `vendor/` with exactly what's described
in `Gopkg.lock`.

`dep ensure` is safe to run early and often. See the help text for more detailed
usage instructions.

```sh
$ dep help ensure
```

### Installing dependencies

(if your `vendor/` directory isn't [checked in with your code](docs/FAQ.md#should-i-commit-my-vendor-directory))

<!-- may change with https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/489 -->

```sh
$ dep ensure
```

If a dependency already exists in your `vendor/` folder, dep will ensure it
matches the constraints from the manifest. If the dependency is missing from
`vendor/`, the latest version allowed by your manifest will be installed.

### Adding a dependency

1. `import` the package in your `*.go` source code file(s).
1. Run the following command to update your `Gopkg.lock` and populate `vendor/` with the new dependency.

    ```sh
    $ dep ensure
    ```

### Changing dependencies

If you want to:

* Change the allowed `version`/`branch`/`revision`
* Switch to using a fork

for one or more dependencies, do the following:

1. Modify your `Gopkg.toml`.
1. Run

    ```sh
    $ dep ensure
    ```

### Checking the status of dependencies

Run `dep status` to see the current status of all your dependencies.

```sh
$ dep status
PROJECT                             CONSTRAINT     VERSION        REVISION  LATEST
github.com/Masterminds/semver       branch 2.x     branch 2.x     139cc09   c2e7f6c
github.com/Masterminds/vcs          ^1.11.0        v1.11.1        3084677   3084677
github.com/armon/go-radix           *              branch master  4239b77   4239b77
```

On top of that, if you have added new imports to your project or modified the manifest file without running `dep ensure` again, `dep status` will tell you there is a mismatch between the lock file and the current status of the project.

```sh
$ dep status
Lock inputs-digest mismatch due to the following packages missing from the lock:

PROJECT                         MISSING PACKAGES
github.com/Masterminds/goutils  [github.com/Masterminds/goutils]

This happens when a new import is added. Run `dep ensure` to install the missing packages.
```

As `dep status` suggests, run `dep ensure` to update your lockfile. Then run `dep status` again, and the lock mismatch should go away.

### Updating dependencies

(to the latest version allowed by the manifest)

```sh
$ dep ensure -update
```

### Removing dependencies

1. Remove the `import`s and all usage from your code.
1. Run

    ```sh
    $ dep ensure
    ```

1. Remove from `Gopkg.toml`, if it was in there.

### Testing changes to a dependency

Making changes in your `vendor/` directory directly is not recommended, as dep
will overwrite any changes. Instead:

1. Delete the dependency from the `vendor/` directory.

    ```sh
    rm -rf vendor/<dependency>
    ```

1. Add that dependency to your `GOPATH`, if it isn't already.

    ```sh
    $ go get <dependency>
    ```

1. Modify the dependency in `$GOPATH/src/<dependency>`.
1. Test, build, etc.

Don't run `dep ensure` until you're done. `dep ensure` will reinstall the
dependency into `vendor/` based on your manifest, as if you were installing from
scratch.

This solution works for short-term use, but for something long-term, take a look
at [virtualgo](https://github.com/GetStream/vg).

To test out code that has been pushed as a new version, or to a branch or fork,
see [changing dependencies](#changing-dependencies).

## Semantic Versioning

`dep ensure` a uses an external [semver library](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver) to interpret the version constraints you specify in the manifest. The comparison operators are:

* `=`: equal
* `!=`: not equal
* `>`: greater than
* `<`: less than
* `>=`: greater than or equal to
* `<=`: less than or equal to
* `-`: literal range. Eg: 1.2 - 1.4.5 is equivalent to >= 1.2, <= 1.4.5
* `~`: minor range. Eg: ~1.2.3 is equivalent to >= 1.2.3, < 1.3.0
* `^`: major range. Eg: ^1.2.3 is equivalent to >= 1.2.3, < 2.0.0
* `[xX*]`: wildcard. Eg: 1.2.x is equivalent to >= 1.2.0, < 1.3.0

You might, for example, include a constraint in your manifest that specifies `version = "=2.0.0"` to pin a dependency to version 2.0.0, or constrain to minor releases with: `version = "2.*"`. Refer to the [semver library](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver) documentation for more info.

**Note**: When you specify a version *without an operator*, `dep` automatically uses the `^` operator by default. `dep ensure` will interpret the given version as the min-boundry of a range, for example:

* `1.2.3` becomes the range `>=1.2.3, <2.0.0`
* `0.2.3` becomes the range `>=0.2.3, <0.3.0`
* `0.0.3` becomes the range `>=0.0.3, <0.1.0`

## Feedback
